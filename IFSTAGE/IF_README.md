For the implementation of the Instruction Fetch (IF) stage, a 32-bit input signal (PC_Immed) was used, which was logically shifted left (SLL) by "10" (i.e., by 2 bits), and also served as an input to an adder. Additionally, a 2-to-1 multiplexer was used with a 1-bit input condition signal (PC_sel), receiving as inputs: the 32-bit signal from the adder and the 32-bit signal representing the PC incremented by "0100" (i.e., by 4).

Subsequently, a submodule (PC) was created, which took as inputs: the 32-bit output of the multiplexer, a 1-bit signal (PC_LdEn) that enabled writing to the PC, a 1-bit Reset signal that cleared the PC output for one cycle when activated, and a Clock signal.

In summary, the Instruction Fetch (IF) stage, depending on the 1-bit input signal (PC_sel), produced a 32-bit output (PC_Out), which was either incremented by "0100" (4) or incremented by the left-shifted (by 2 bits) PC_Immed input plus "0100" (4), based on the previous output.

To implement the Instruction Fetch (IF) stage in the Xilinx environment, the port mapping technique was used to properly connect the generated circuits. The following standard libraries were also used: use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL, use ieee.numeric_std.all, and use ieee.std_logic_unsigned.all.
