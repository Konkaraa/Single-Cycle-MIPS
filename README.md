# The purpose of this project is the development of a 
#processor that operates with a single clock cycle and is implemented using components 
#of a non-pipelined processor based on a subset of the CHARIS (CHAnia Risc Instruction Set) 
#instruction set architecture. This project consists of three (3) phases, with the final (3rd) 
#phase integrating the contents of each previous phase. The design of the phases is carried out in VHDL, 
#and their simulation is performed using the Xilinx ISE 14.7 tool.
